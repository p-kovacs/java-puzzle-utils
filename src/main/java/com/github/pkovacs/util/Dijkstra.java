/**
 * Implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a> for
 * finding shortest paths in weighted graphs. This algorithm only supports non-negative edge weights.
 * If you also need negative weights, use {@link BellmanFord} instead.
 * <p>
 * The input is a directed or undirected {@link WeightedGraph} and one or more source nodes. For each execution of
 * the algorithm, it advances from any node of the graph at most once.
 * <p>
 * Some methods also take a target predicate as an argument in order to find a path to a single target node
 * instead of all nodes. In this case, the algorithm terminates when one of the shortest paths is found for a
 * target node having minimum distance from the (nearest) source node. This way, paths can also be searched for
 * in huge or (theoretically) infinite graphs provided that the nodes and edges are generated on-the-fly when
 * requested by the algorithm. For example, the nodes and edges might represent the feasible states and steps of
 * a game or a combinatorial problem, respectively, and we might not be able to or do not want to enumerate all
 * possible (and reachable) states in advance.
